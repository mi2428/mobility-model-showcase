# mobility-model-showcase

Helping better understanding of mobility models by visualizing the properties of them interactively with HTML5 canvas.
This is for students studying ad-hoc networks (like me).

It works, but the code is not as sophisticated as it could be, so use with care if you are not familiar with Javascript.

## Supported models (TBD)
- Random waypoint model
- Reference point group mobility model (RPGM) [1]
